Hello everyone! My name is Linsong Wang, and I'm in my final semester here at Northeastern University (NEU). Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to intern in various fields, ranging from deep learning and robotics to full-stack and backend development. My passions are in the areas of computer vision and high-performance computing. Interestingly, web development always hasn't been my primary interest in the computer science world. Nonetheless, I'm taking this course with an open mind and am excited to discover new aspects of this field that could be fun and useful for me.
I like cooking and live near our campus. Feel free to reach out to me if interested study together in the future.
Look forward to learning alongside all of you and expanding my skill set in unexpected ways!
