# Personal Portfolio

## Writeup:
### What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?

Most challenge part is that our scope is inside the html and css. It is classical (old) tools. I spent a lot of time trying every attribute to see how that would work on my website. And for some simple function with libraries and others, it is hard for html and css to achieve it. For example, I would like to build some geek style animation in the website which looks fancy but I finally gave up because even though I could make it happen, it would be more functional and easier to build it with JS and other helper tools. 

HTML and CSS are not easy. It's frustrating actually. The html is hard to read and iterate. The css is loose so after a while of development, I need to remember all of the items and their connections with html. I got two large screen so it works. But it still frustrates me much.

The whole coding process took me mroe than two half-day's work. And the design process happens whenever I happened to think about this.

### What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
Generally, when the screen size is small, the font size and some icons and images will shrink to match the screen. Moreover, in the photos page, the display attribute will use flex to show the photos, which is originally grid in large screen.

All of the screen sizes in chrome inspect have been tested. It should be good enough to support most of the current mobile devices.

### What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
This design is for professional portfolio. So in my opinion, it is important to make it clean and straightforward. I've chosen a great color palette and fonts. Each page is clean and people looking at these pages could easily get all of the important information directly. That's all of the portfolio.

### Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
As mentioned above, I would add more fancy features. Common ones would be adding panels such as some github statistics. Furthermore, some interactive function is also interesting here.

### How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
Two half-day's coding work. About 16 hours (etc.)
